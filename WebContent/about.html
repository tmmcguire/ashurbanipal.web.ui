    <h1>About this project</h1>

    <p>This system provides a text recommendation engine based on
      natural-language processing and the data from the Project
      Gutenberg 2010 DVD.</p>

    <h2>Style</h2>

    <p>To produce the style recommendations, I tagged each word in
      each text with its part-of-speech and calculated the proportions
      of each part-of-speech in the text. Tagging was handled with
      the <a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/tagger.shtml">Stanford
      Part-Of-Speech Tagger</a>. Each text is then represented by a
      vector of the proportions of each part-of-speech. I use the
      Euclidian distance between the text chosen by the user and each
      of the remaining texts to calculate the recommendations, with a
      smaller distance being a stronger recommendation.</p>

    <h2>Topic</h2>

    <p>Topic recommendations are also based on the part-of-speech
      tagging: I collected the 200 most common nouns from each text
      and assumed the set represents the topics in the text. The
      recommendations are based on
      the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index">Jaccard
      distance</a> between the sets of nouns for each text, with a
      smaller Jaccard distance producing a stronger
      recommendation.</p>

    <h2>Combined recommendations</h2>

    <p>The combined recommendation is produced by multiplying the
      Euclidian distance computed by the style recommendation by the
      Jaccard distance produced by the topic recommendation. Since the
      Jaccard distance will always be between 0.0 and 1.0, with zero
      being a perfect match and one indicating no overlap, this has
      the effect of reducing the style distance values for those texts
      which are topically similar.</p>

    <h2>News</h2>

    <p><b>Saturday, 25 July 2015:</b> In an effort to cheapen services, 
      I have trained new ferrets to serve the backend data. These rust-colored
      ferrets are heavily addicted to caffeine and should be somewhat 
      faster, but may produce slightly different results to title, author,
      and subject searches. Those that were replaced are in training for
      text processing tasks.</p>

    <p><b>Friday, 26 June 2015:</b> After considerable training, I
      taught the ferrets handling title, author, and subject searches
      a scheme that should allow them to be a little more tolerant of
      spelling problems. Finding "Shakespear" should be much easier
      now.</p>
    <p>In fact, they're now using
      the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_State_Identification_and_Intelligence_System">NYSIIS</a>
      soundex algorithm
      from <a href="https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-codec/">Apache
      Commons Codec</a>. But don't tell them that, they'll just get
      all confused.</p>

    <h2>Software</h2>

      <li><a href="https://github.com/tmmcguire/rust_ashurbanipal_web">rust_ashurbanipal_web</a>
        now serves data requests including source text and recommendations.</li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/tmmcguire/ashurbanipal.web.ui">ashurbanipal.web.ui</a>

      <li><a href="https://github.com/tmmcguire/ashurbanipal.web">ashurbanipal.web</a>
        originally provided the web services used to identify the user's source
        text and compute the recommendations.</li>
